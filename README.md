# Steganography with Semantic Awareness

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing steganography with semantic awareness using a U-Net architecture. Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an ordinary, non-secret file or message to avoid detection. Semantic awareness ensures that the hidden information is embedded in a way that maintains the semantic integrity of the cover image.
